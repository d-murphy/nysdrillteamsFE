### The plan:

#### Pages: 
* Welcome Page, see napkin
* RunDB - Three Man, sorted by time.  Controls to filter by Team, Year, Tournament, County
* TotalPointsDB - Sum of Points.  Controls to filter by Year, Tournament, County
* List of tournaments, sorted by date.  Filters for County, Year, Team?, Tournament  (schedule view - year filter)
* For each tournament, "view best times at [track]" or [tournament] - launches run DB pre-filtered
* Tracks - display facts and images, list of tournaments.  (schedule view, no circuit or year filter)
* Tournament View - (is this an opportunity for web socket) (scorecard view)
* home page - [test if live](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32454238/how-to-check-if-youtube-channel-is-streaming-live)
    * bootstrap for image car.
